        <p>Something exciting happened... 
            
            I started this blog! And it's good because I've broken my foot and it hurts like a bitch so this is a great distraction. Yup.

        <h6> A little later on 14th May 2020</h6>
        
        <p> I'm sitting here with my boot up on the coffee table, writing my <del>first</del> second ever blog post, styled using CSS. Shit's lit yo.<br>
        I just found out that the strike tag is obsolete, so I had to find out which one to use instead. Apparently it's the del tag nowadays. Can't keep up with these computer kids :O <br>
            Watch this... <br>
            <del>Strike tag</del>
